1. the given file ctclassfication.py is a supervised ML learning algorithm to classify the clinical trial data into Drug, Devices, and Others. The algorithms run on sample open-source clinical trial data i.e. ctclassification.csv
2. clinicaltrialsvis.py file will generate the dynamic visualization of clinical trails data i.e ctVis.csv with basic information.
